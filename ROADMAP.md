# Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Working MVP
Goal: full pipeline working end-to-end, single market analysis.

- [ ] Backend scaffold (FastAPI, requirements.txt, Makefile)
- [ ] `models.py`: Market, Analysis, ScanResult, MarketWithAnalysis
- [ ] `db.py`: init_db, upsert_markets, save_analysis, get_latest_analysis
- [ ] `polymarket.py`: fetch_markets, fetch_all_active (with pagination)
- [ ] `analyzer.py`: analyze_market with Claude + web_search
- [ ] `main.py`: /health, /markets, /markets/{id}/analyze
- [ ] Frontend: MarketList + MarketCard with analyze button
- [ ] Frontend: divergence display (Market X% → Claude Y%, ±Npp badge)
- [ ] Frontend: tag filter chips
- [ ] Verify full pipeline: fetch → analyze → display divergence

## Phase 2 — Scanner
Goal: batch scan to surface top opportunities.

- [ ] `scanner.py`: scan() with semaphore + delay
- [ ] `main.py`: POST /scan endpoint
- [ ] Frontend: ScannerView with form + results table
- [ ] Filters: min volume, max analysis age, min divergence threshold
- [ ] Sort results by divergence magnitude
- [ ] "Export to CSV" button

## Phase 3 — Persistence & History
Goal: build up a log of analyses over time.

- [ ] `db.py`: get_analysis_history, get_analysis_age_hours
- [ ] `main.py`: /markets/{id} with full history, /analyses paginated
- [ ] Frontend: "analyzed N times" badge on MarketCard
- [ ] Frontend: history panel (past estimates over time)
- [ ] Frontend: re-analyze diff view (estimate shifted by X pp since last run)
- [ ] POST /markets/refresh: re-fetch markets from Polymarket API

## Phase 4 — Calibration Integration
Goal: track resolution and feed into calibration tracker.

- [ ] `db.py`: mark_resolution, get_all_resolved_analyses
- [ ] `main.py`: PUT /markets/{id}/resolution
- [ ] Frontend: "Mark resolved" button on closed markets
- [ ] Auto-resolution: detect closed markets on refresh, extract outcome from Polymarket
- [ ] `scripts/import_calibration.py`: import from existing tracker
- [ ] Export calibration data: claude_prob + resolution pairs as CSV/JSON
- [ ] Brier score calculation over rolling window
- [ ] Calibration curve view (bucketed accuracy chart)

## Phase 5 — Advanced
Goal: automation, intelligence, and portfolio simulation.

- [x] Scheduled background fetching — stdlib `threading.Timer` in `scheduler.py` (not APScheduler); `SCAN_INTERVAL_HOURS` + `AUTO_RESOLUTION_INTERVAL_HOURS`
- [x] Change detection: flag markets whose price moved since analysis — `db.is_stale` (4pp via `STALE_THRESHOLD`), surfaced as the stale badge
- [x] Re-analysis suggestions for stale estimates — stale badge + manual re-analyze; optional auto-reanalysis via `STALE_REANALYZE_INTERVAL_HOURS` (`scanner.reanalyze_stale`)
- [x] Portfolio simulator — `scripts/portfolio_sim.py` (crowd fade-to-0.5 Kelly baseline); own-signal realized P&L shown in the Signals view
- [x] Backtesting — `scripts/backtest_crowd_calibration.py` (crowd calibration vs outcomes; read-only baseline, not a forward Claude backtest)
- [x] Multi-model comparison — cross-model adversarial refutation (`CROSS_MODEL_ADVERSARIAL`, `analyzer.refute_edge`); verdict column in the scanner
- [x] Model leaderboard — per-model LLM eval (Brier / log-loss / accuracy / Brier skill) via `calibration.model_leaderboard`; `/api/leaderboard` + Leaderboard view
- [x] Signal performance dashboard — equity curve, return-on-cost, per-trade Sharpe, max drawdown via `performance.py`; `/api/performance` + Performance view
- [x] Webhook notification for high-divergence markets — `scanner.emit_alerts` → `data/alerts.jsonl` + `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`; alerts table in the UI

## Future polish
- [x] Add log rotation or size cap for data/app.log (currently unbounded append) — RotatingFileHandler via `app._init_logging()`
- [x] Exclude analyses where claude_prob=1.0 and summary contains '1%' from calibration queries (parser-corrupted rows, id=14) — filtered via `db._NOT_CORRUPTED`

## Won't do (scope limits)
- Actual Polymarket trading / order placement (read-only by design)
- User authentication (local tool, single user)
- Deployment to cloud (designed for local use + Mac Mini via Tailscale)
